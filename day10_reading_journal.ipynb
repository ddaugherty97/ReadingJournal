    "# Day 10 Reading Journal\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pure Functions\n",
    "1. Pure functions do not modify any of the objects passed into its arguments\n",
    "2. These functions will return a value that does not modify anything passed into it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifiers\n",
    "1. Modifiers are the opposite of pure fuctions\n",
    "2. They will change the objects passed into its parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prototyping versus Planning\n",
    "1. prototyping and fixing is an effective way to address uncomplex functions\n",
    "2. Planned development is a more effective way to address complex functions\n",
    "3. Planned development requires much more insight into the problem before actually writing the code\n",
    "4. For example, identifying that the Time object is really a three digit number in base 60"

    "Write a boolean function called `is_after` that takes two `Time` objects, `t1` and `t2`, and returns `True` if `t1` follows `t2` chronologically and `False` otherwise. Challenge: don’t use an `if` statement. "

    "\n",
    "#### Object-Oriented Features\n",
    "1. Python is an object oriented programming language\n",
    "2. Each object within the program relates to some concept in the real world\n",
    "3. methods are functions associated with a particular class\n",
    "4. methods do not relate to concepts in the real world; they are specific to the class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Init Method within a Class\n",
    "1. The init method is a method called when a object is instantiated\n",
    "2. Initializes all parameters withing the object to a defined value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Str Method within a Class\n",
    "1. str methods in a class are ways to display your object in the proper format\n",
    "2. python's built in print will return the location of the object in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type-Based Dispatch\n",
    "1. Methods written for a specific class to allow for commands in python to work for classes\n",
    "2. For example writing an add method to allow for the + operator to work for two objects in the same class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polymorphism\n",
    "1. functions that work with several types"

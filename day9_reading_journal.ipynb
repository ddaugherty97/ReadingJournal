    "# Day 9 Reading Journal\n",
    "\n",
    "This journal includes several required exercises, but it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use the journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from Think Python deeply.\n",

    "The content in this chapter could be very helpful for the text mining mini project. The reading and all exercises within are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Section 13.3-4 gives a good example of some techniques for working with files, processing text, and doing some simple analysis. \n",
    " - Section 13.8 and the Markov generation in Exercise 8 can be a lot of fun. \n",
    " - Now that you know a wide range of different data structures, Section 13.9 starts to give some guidance for choosing between them\n",
    " - Section 13.10 explains Allen's \"4 r's\" of debugging strategy\n",

    " #### Random Module\n",
    " 1. Programs that are not random are said to be deterministic\n",
    " 2. the random module produces pseudorandom numbers\n",
    " 3. the function random.choice(list) will choose a random element within the list\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Optional Parameters\n",
    " 1. to make a optional parameter, set the parameter to a default value\n",
    " 2. passing in a parameter will overide the default value\n",

    " #### Dictionary Subtraction\n",
    " 1. this function can be used to find all of the entries that are in one dictionary and not the other\n",
    "\n",
    " #### Markov Analysis\n",
    " 1. Can be used to predict what words should follow one another when given a bunch of random words\n",
    " 2. Random sentences that should make more sense can be generated by matching the prefixes to the appropriate suffixes"

    "This chapter has very few (and short) exercises, and is more focused on starting to think about classes and objects. If you haven't seen user defined types like classes before, you should read closely and try out some examples on your own. For example, you can write a [Python Tutor example like this one](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=%23+Example+for+visualizing+object+diagrams+by+stepping+through+the+code%0A%0Aclass+Point(object%29%3A%0A++++%22%22%22Represents+a+point+in+2-D+space.%22%22%22%0A++++pass%0A%0Aclass+Rectangle(object%29%3A%0A++++%22%22%22Represents+a+rectangle.+%0A%0A++++attributes%3A+width,+height,+corner.%0A++++%22%22%22%0A++++pass%0A%0A%0A%23+Create+a+point+to+serve+as+origin+for+our+rectangles%0Ap+%3D+Point(%29%0Ap.x+%3D+10%0Ap.y+%3D+15%0A%0A%23+Create+two+rectangles+with+different+size%0Ar1+%3D+Rectangle(%29%0Ar1.corner+%3D+p%0Ar1.width+%3D+100%0Ar1.height+%3D+100%0A%0Ar2+%3D+Rectangle(%29%0Ar2.corner+%3D+p%0Ar2.width+%3D+50%0Ar2.height+%3D+200%0A%0A%23+Change+the+width+of+r2+-+what+(if+any%29+is+the+effect+on+r1+and+why%3F%0Ar2.width+%3D+150%0Aprint+r1.width%0A%0A%23+Change+the+corner+position+of+r1+-+what+(if+any%29+is+the+effect+on+r2+and+why%3F%0Ar1.corner.x+%3D+20%0Aprint+r2.corner.x&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&textReferences=false&py=2&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&curInstr=0) to explore object diagrams and aliasing.\n",

    "#### User-Defined Types\n",
    "1. Types can be created in python by creating a class for the specific type\n",
    "2. a class definition is defined...  class point(object)\n",
    "3. point is the name of the class and it is an object\n",
    "4. variables can be set to have a value of a class, this is called creating a new instance of the class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "1. assigning values to an instance can be done using dot notation (ex. blank.x = 3.0)\n",
    "2. Goes to object blank refers to and sets the variable x equal to something\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instances as Return Value\n",
    "1. A function can return a value in the form of a different class\n",
